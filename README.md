# center - Centers text from stdin! üõ†Ô∏è

###### Originally by [Lizzy Fleckenstein][LizzyFleckenstein03/center] ü§ç

[`center`] reads input from `stdin`, calculates the width of each line
(considering multibyte characters), and center-aligns the text within the
terminal window.

### Highlights

- **Terminal size detection**: Adjusts text to fit the terminal width.
- **Multibyte support**: Handles Unicode characters correctly.
- **Text centering**: Prints each line centered within the terminal.
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of system call failures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

If you are building [`center`], you'll need:

- A C compiler that supports [C99] or later.

### Installing

If you have [Homebrew] installed, just run:

```sh
brew install Neved4/homebrew-tap/center
```

### Implementation

[`center`] operates as follows:

1. Opens `/dev/tty` to get the terminal width.
2. Reads input line-by-line.
3. Calculates character width (supporting multibyte characters).
4. Prints each line centered in the terminal.

### Examples

Below is an example of how the [`center`] command works in practice:

```console
$ echo 'Hello World!' | center
                                  Hello World!
```

## Compatibility

Runs on _**Linux**_, _**macOS**_ and _**\*BSD**_ systems on [`x86_64`] and
[`arm64`], and compiles with [`zig`], [`clang`], [`gcc`], [`tcc`] and any other
compiler that supports [C99] or later.

## Standards

[`center`] is compatible with [POSIX.1-2024][][^1] as well as the [C23][][^2] standard.
